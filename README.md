# ArtAttribution_FHE

An anonymous art authentication and attribution network that allows museums and art experts to collaboratively analyze encrypted artwork feature data. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables joint analysis while protecting sensitive artwork information, enhancing accuracy and objectivity in authentication.

## Overview

Art authentication often relies on sensitive data that museums and experts are reluctant to share publicly:

* Artwork feature data, provenance, and historical records are confidential
* Individual museums may lack sufficient data to validate art independently
* Collaborative authentication can be hindered by privacy concerns

ArtAttribution_FHE addresses these issues by allowing multiple institutions to conduct joint analysis on encrypted data. FHE ensures that features remain confidential while enabling precise attribution and authentication.

## Features

### Privacy-Preserving Data Collaboration

* Artwork feature data remains encrypted throughout the process
* Enables joint analysis without exposing sensitive information
* Protects museum and collector privacy

### Expert-Driven Authentication

* Allows art experts to participate anonymously
* Supports structured input of authentication criteria and observations
* Aggregates expert evaluations to identify consensus securely

### Attribution and Provenance Analysis

* Combines multiple encrypted datasets for attribution decisions
* Provides statistical analysis to support authenticity and provenance claims
* Detects patterns and similarities across artworks without revealing originals

### Transparent & Objective Analytics

* Provides aggregated, anonymized reports for decision-making
* Reduces bias and subjectivity in authentication results
* Enhances confidence in attributions while preserving privacy

## Architecture

### Museum & Expert Client

* Web-based or desktop application for submitting encrypted artwork features
* Encrypts data with FHE before transmission
* Tracks authentication status anonymously

### Analysis Server

* Performs homomorphic computation across encrypted datasets
* Aggregates expert input for authentication and attribution analysis
* Returns encrypted results without accessing raw artwork data

### Administrative Dashboard

* Visualizes anonymized consensus and attribution statistics
* Maintains security and confidentiality of artwork and expert data
* Provides workflow monitoring for participating institutions

## Technology Stack

### Core Cryptography

* Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for joint analysis on encrypted data
* Ensures no sensitive feature or provenance information is exposed

### Backend

* Node.js / Python server for encrypted computation
* Secure APIs for transmitting encrypted artwork and receiving results
* Optimized for multiple concurrent institutions and experts

### Frontend

* React + TypeScript for interactive museum and expert interfaces
* Real-time feedback on encrypted analysis outcomes
* Visualization of aggregated, anonymized authentication results

### Security Measures

* End-to-end encryption from client submission to server analysis
* Immutable logging of submissions and consensus results
* TLS-secured network communication
* FHE ensures computations occur without decrypting sensitive data

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

* Modern browser or desktop application
* Secure network connection to analysis server
* Optional administrative dashboard for monitoring outcomes

### Setup Steps

1. Deploy museum and expert client applications.
2. Configure analysis server for homomorphic computation.
3. Set up administrative dashboard for anonymized reporting.
4. Test FHE computation workflow to ensure accuracy and privacy compliance.

## Usage

### Museum Workflow

1. Submit encrypted artwork feature data.
2. Track anonymized authentication and attribution results.
3. Receive aggregated consensus without exposing original data.

### Expert Workflow

* Provide encrypted evaluations and observations
* Participate in collaborative authentication anonymously
* Access aggregated outcomes for decision-making

## Security Considerations

* All data encrypted at the client-side before transmission
* FHE enables secure joint computation without revealing artwork features
* Immutable logs prevent tampering with submissions or analysis results
* TLS-secured network ensures safe data transmission

## Roadmap & Future Enhancements

* Integration with additional museum databases for broader analysis
* AI-assisted attribution models operating on encrypted features
* Enhanced mobile and tablet interfaces for experts
* Multi-institution workflow optimization for global collaboration
* Advanced visualization of provenance and similarity patterns

## Conclusion

ArtAttribution_FHE demonstrates how cryptography can empower collaborative art authentication. By leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption, museums and experts can jointly analyze artwork data while preserving privacy, improving objectivity, and increasing confidence in attribution outcomes.
